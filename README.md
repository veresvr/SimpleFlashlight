## Usage

The main assembly consist of several 3D printed parts, a pcb assembly, a switch button and other parts which are listed in  [AssemblyBOM.pdf](https://github.com/veresvr/SimpleFlashlight/tree/main/AssemblyBOM.pdf "BOM of SolidWorks assembly").
All electronics components you need for the pcb is described here [BOMforPCB.pdf](https://github.com/veresvr/SimpleFlashlight/tree/main/Electronics/BOMforPCB.pdf "BOM of Altium assembly").

The PCB design was created with Altium Designer 19. All mechanical parts and assemblies were created with SolidWorks 2020.
