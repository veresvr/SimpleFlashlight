## Usage

The main assembly consist of several 3D printed parts, a pcb assembly, a switch button and other parts which are listed in  [.../3D/BOM.pdf](https://github.com/veresvr/SimpleFlashlight/tree/main/3D/BOM.pdf "BOM of SolidWorks assembly").
You can read how it comes together in this tutorial [.../Assembling manual.pdf](https://github.com/veresvr/SimpleFlashlight/tree/main/Assembling manual.pdf "Assembling Manual") or watch this [FlashlightAssembly](https://youtu.be/R4zijvSld24 "Video on YouTube") video.
What components you need for the pcb is described here [.../Electronics/BOMforPCB.pdf](https://github.com/veresvr/SimpleFlashlight/tree/main/Electronics/BOMforPCB.pdf "BOM of Altium assembly").

The PCB design was created with Altium Designer 19. All mechanical parts and assemblies were created with SolidWorks 2020.
